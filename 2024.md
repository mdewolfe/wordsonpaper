# Finished in 2024

## **Dune**, Frak Herbert

I think I finished this in 2024, I don't really remember, so I an syaing this is
a true statement.

## **The Left Hand of Darkness**, Ursula LeGuin

One of the best books I have ever read. Highly recommended.

## **1984**, Georg Orwell

***THIS IS NOT A TODO LIST PEOPLE!!***. More of a warning. Pay attention.
