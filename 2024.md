# Finished in 2024

## **Dune**, Frank Herbert

I think I finished this in 2024, I don't really remember, so I an syaing this is
a true statement.

## **Fahrenheit 451**, Ray Bradbury

***Amazing how this novel predicted the present day.***

Like , Dune, I kind of forget when I finished, so it goes here.

---

## **The Left Hand of Darkness**, Ursula LeGuin

One of the best books I have ever read. Highly recommended.

---

## **1984**, George Orwell

***THIS IS NOT A TODO LIST PEOPLE!!***. More of a warning. Pay attention.

## Blood Meridian, Cormac McCarthy

Great book with an ending to think about. Hard to follow at times, though. I am not
sure why people call this “The American Novel.” If that is the case, Americans enjoy
too much grotesque violence.

Go read it!
